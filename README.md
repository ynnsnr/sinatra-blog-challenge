You'll find 2 parts to this test:

**1/ Questions**

Take a look at questions.txt and answer the questions presented to you

**2/ Sinatra Exercise**

This is a fullstack exercise, creating a simple webapp in Sinatra

Sinatra is a simple web framework for Ruby, similar in logic to Rails. It uses [erb](http://www.stuartellis.eu/articles/erb/), and can take routes with parameters.

=> [Github](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra)

*Don't forget to run ```gem install sinatra``` && ```gem install sinatra-contrib``` in order to run the program*

In this simple exercise, a database of posts and comments is given to you (see Database.rb). Comments are ordered to match each post (first comment array - first post, etc.).

Your goal is to create a credible web application listing posts and comments. The app must make intelligent use of the components of each post, and overall look like a real web app. The rest is completely up to you.

This is a test of your front-end, back-end capabilities, as well as your creativity. We will be looking for:

- A clean backend code

- A professional-looking front-end

- A surprising feature: something we wouldn't have thought about.

Overall, we're just looking for you to surprise us!
